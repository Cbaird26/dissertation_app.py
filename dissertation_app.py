    The quest for a Theory of Everything (ToE) has been a central theme in theoretical physics for decades. 
    This dissertation introduces Baird's Principle, a novel approach aimed at unifying the fundamental forces 
    of nature. Baird's Principle builds upon the successes and addresses the limitations of existing theories 
    by integrating general relativity, quantum mechanics, string theory, and loop quantum gravity into a 
    cohesive framework.
